way.js
======

Simple, lightweight, persistent, framework-agnostic two-way databinding Javascript library (with no to little JS code to write).

[Demo](https://gwendall.github.io/way)  
[Codepen](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/fkEqw)

## Quick start ##

Declare an HTML element with some tags.

```html

  <form way-data="myFormData" way-persistent="true">
  	<input type="text" name="name">
  	<input type="text" name="age">
  	<input type="text" name="gender">
  </form>

  Name: <span way-data="myFormData.name"></span>

```

Boom. Now every change in the form will be stored in-memory. The bound span's html will be changed on the fly. And the bound data will be persistent, meaning your HTML will be populated with your data on page reloads.

Enough talk, [see it in action](https://gwendall.github.io/way).

## Installation ##

Step 1: Include the bundled library to your page.

```html
<script src="/way.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

Step 2: There is no step 2. You are good to go.

Note: The bundled version contains the required dependencies (listed below). Feel free to include them separately.

```html
<script src="/vendor/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/underscore.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/underscore.json.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/form2js.js"></script>
<script src="/vendor/js2form.js"></script>
<script src="/way.min.js"></script>
```

## Options ##

Options can be passed via data attributes or JavaScript. For data attributes, append the option name to way-, as in way-data="".
Set these options to the elements that have to be bound.

Name | Type | Default | Description
----|------|---- | ----
data | string | null | Allows to define the dot separated path where the data will be stored. Can include arrays. When used on a form, a json variable made of all the included inputs with a [name] attribute will be created and stored in the specified storage. Pass the "\_\_all\_\_" path to access all way.js' data.
default | string | null | A link to a default data to set on an element, in case there is no bound value.
persistent | boolean | true | Allows to store the data to localStorage everytime the bound data changes.
readonly | boolean | false | Prevents the element changes from resetting the bound value.
writeonly | Boolean | false | Prevents the element from getting changed when the bound value changes.
json | boolean | false | Returns pretty-printed json data to its DOM element.
html | boolean | false | Declares whether the data attributed to an element should be parsed as HTML or not.
pick | array | null | A comma separated list of values to pick (in forms only) to sync with the storage. By default, all form inputs are synced.
omit | array | null | A comma separated list of values (in forms only) to not sync with the storage. By default, no form input is omitted.

Some examples:

```html
<form way-data="some.form" way-pick="some,properties,that,can.be.nested">
```

```html
<form way-data="some.form" way-omit="dont,want.those">
```

```html
<img way-data="some.image" way-default="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a6/Bender_Rodriguez.png">
```

```html
<pre way-data="some.json" way-json="true"></pre>
```

<!--
- prettyprint (?)
-->

## Helper classes ##

**For images only**    
way.js adds classes to your DOM elements to easily detect load / error / success statuses with the data they get passed.  

Class | Description
---- | ------
way-loading | When an image is getting downloaded to a DOM element
way-error | When no image is returned from the URL provided
way-success | When... Well, you got it.

```javascript
way.set("image.url", "somethingThatsNotAnImageURL");
```  
```html
<img way-data="image.url">
<!-- Gets a class ".way-error" attributed -->
```

## Methods ##

Everything should be done for you from the HTML tags. But if necessary, you can also use helper functions to interact with your stored data and DOM elements. 

Notes: 
- [element] refers to the jQuery selector of a DOM element
- [options] is optional. By default, options are read from the HTML tags of the elements. But you can overwrite them, by passing this parameter.

### DOM methods

**way.dom(element).toStorage(options)**  
Stores the element's value to the in-store memory.
```javascript
way.dom("#someForm").toStorage()
```

**way.dom(element).fromStorage(options)**  
Sets the element's value from the stored one.
```javascript
way.dom("#someForm").fromStorage()
```

**way.dom(element).toJSON(options)**  
Returns a JSON with the parsed data of the input (particularly handy for forms).
```javascript
way.dom("#someForm").toJSON()

>> {
		its: "values",
		serialized: {
			in: "a json"
		}
	}
```

**way.dom(element).fromJSON(data, options)**  
Sets the element's value from any data (in json).
```javascript
way.dom("#someForm").fromJSON({name:"John Doe"})
```

**way.dom(element).getValue()**  
Returns a structured JSON containing the value of the DOM element.
```javascript
way.dom("#someForm").getValue()
```

**way.dom(element).setValue(value, options)**  
Sets the element's value from any data (in json).
```javascript
way.dom("#someForm").setValue({name:"John Doe"})
```

**way.dom(element).setDefault(force)**  
Sets the default value of an element. By default, only the DOM element gets its value set to the default value. Its bound value in the datastore in unchanged. Pass a [force] parameter if you need to force setting in-memory value of this data to the element's default value.
```javascript
way.dom("#someForm").setDefault()
```

**way.setDefaults(force)**  
Sets all the default values of bound DOM elements.
```javascript
way.setDefaults()
```

**way.dom(element).getOptions()**  
Returns the list of the ["way-"] options attributed to a DOM element.
```javascript
way.dom("#someForm").getOptions()
```

### Data methods

**way.get(selector)**  
Returns the value of the data stored under a given pathname.
```javascript
way.get("some.path");
>> "bonjour"
```

**way.set(selector, value, options)**  
Saves the data in memory under the specified pathname.
```javascript
way.set("some.path", "bonjour!");
```

**way.remove(selector, options)**  
Removes the data stored under a given pathname.
```javascript
way.remove("some.path");
way.get("some.path");
>> undefined
```

**way.clear(options)**  
Clears all the data
```javascript
way.clear();
way.get();
>> {}
```

### localStorage methods

**way.backup()**  
Stores the data saved in way.js' datastore to localStorage.
```javascript
way.backup();
```

**way.restore()**  
Restores the data saved in localStorage. Called on $(document).ready by default (can be changed with [global options](way.js#global-options)).
```javascript
way.restore();
```

### Binding methods

**way.registerBindings()**  
Triggers a scan of the DOM to find and save the elements with the [way-data] attribute, that will be bound with some data. 
```javascript
way.registerBindings()
```

**way.updateBindings(selector)**  
Sets the value of all the DOM elements binded to a data selector with their values in way.js' datastore. If omitted, all (excluding write-only's and omitted) DOM elements with a "way-data=" attribute will be refreshed.
```javascript
way.updateBindings("formData.name")
```

### Watcher methods

**way.watch(selector, callback[value])**  
Watches changes of a given value.
```javascript
way.watch("some.data", function(value) {
	console.log("Data has been updated to value: " + value);
});
```

**way.watchAll(callback[selector, value])**  
Watches all changes in way.js' datastore.
```javascript
way.watchAll(function(selector, value) {
	console.log("The data " + selector + " has been changed.", value);
});
```

## Global options ##

**way.options.persistent** (Boolean)  
Sets whether or not data will be saved to / restored from localStorage (true by default).
```javascript
way.options.persistent = true
```

**way.options.timeoutInput** (Number)  
Number of milliseconds of the timeout between keypresses on bound elements to store their values to the datastore (50 by default).
```javascript
way.options.timeoutInput = 50
```

**way.options.timeoutDOM** (Number)  
Number of milliseconds of the timeout between scans of the DOM to list bound elements on each DOM change (500 by default).
```javascript
way.options.timeoutDOM = 500
```
